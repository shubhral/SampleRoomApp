# SampleRoomApp

My attempt to create a sample app to demonstrate the new persistance library - Room introduced by Google as part of android architecture components.

# Working

The app consists of 2 screens - 
1. Screen which shows list of tasks added
2. Screen to add a new task

# Todo
1. Reorder functionality
2. Edit existing task
3. Delete task
